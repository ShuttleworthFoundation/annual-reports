	    <p>It has been 4 years since we have changed our funding
	      structure, to invest in the person with the innovative
	      idea, rather than the idea itself.  This has helped us
	      be more agile and stay on track when specific project
	      milestones no longer made sense in a changing landscape.
	      It has also helped our investments go further, the
	      initiatives no longer end when the funding does, but
	      continue long after the Fellow leaves the programme.</p>
	    <p>We continue to be excited about those that can both
	      articulate their idea and also put it into action. 2012
	      saw us bring 4 new Fellows into the programme working in
	      diverse areas, conflict resolution and open hardware
	      being entirely new for our support.</p>

	    <p>Whilst the Fellows are treading the path of optimising
	      social impact and determining sustainability, at the
	      Foundation, we are learning how to create a safe space
	      for shared learning with the best blend of funding and
	      support.</p>
	    <p>A fundamental part of our theory of change is that
	      being deliberately, legally and practically open is the
	      best way to make our ideas spread. We invest in open as
	      as the default and challenge the notion that being
	      closed is key to building sustainable advantages. This
	      idea is not so alien in 2012. Governments around the
	      world are opening up data to its citizens. Educational
	      institutions are starting to experience the benefits of
	      embracing open educational resources and at the frontier
	      of openness, businesses are creatively venturing into
	      this new landscape.</p>

	  <h1>Where we focus our energy</h1>
	  <p>We have a modest amount of funding, and big ideas. We want
	    to find keys that unlock barriers and drive change through
	    systems. In 2012 we did that by building an eco-system of
	    open ideas.</p>
	  <p>We supported openness in intellectual property, data,
	    privacy, hardware, education, publishing, government,
	    telecoms and the Web.</p>

	  <h1>How do we spend our money?</h1>
	  <p>The Shuttleworth Foundation Fellowship Program funding is
	    unusual in that it consists of two components for each
	    Fellow - the fellowship grant and matched project
	    funding.</p>
	  <p>The fellowship grant covers the cost of the Fellow&apos;s
	    time for the year and is guaranteed to the fellow for the
	    year. The grant amount varies and is determined by each
	    Fellow&apos;s salary equivalent outside of the
	    fellowship.</p>
	  <p>The project funding is a standard amount of $228,500 set
	    aside per Fellow for project expenses.  This funding is
	    unlocked by a light weight project pitch process and the
	    Fellows are rewarded for investing in their own ideas by
	    the Foundation adding 10 to 20 times as much funding - a
	    co-investment model.</p>
	  <p>Imagine the cost of a Fellow&apos;s time for the year is
	    agreed at $1000. As the fellowship year progresses, the
	    Fellow realises that it would be beneficial to spend $100
	    in order to advance their idea. The Fellow then takes $900
	    home for the cost of her time and reinvests $100 back into
	    the implementation of her idea. The Foundation will
	    contribute at least another $1000, giving her a project
	    budget of $1100.</p>
	  <p>The investment coming partly from the Fellow themselves
	    has a 2-fold effect;
	    <ol>
	      <li>they are really thoughtful about what to spend money
		on and</li>
	      <li>there is true ownership of the project.</li>
	    </ol>

	  <h1>Fellowship applications</h1>
	  <p>The Foundation was launched in South Africa in 2001 and
	    is well known there. It is therefore not entirely
	    unexpected that there are still strong ties with South
	    Africa as can be seen by the flow of money to South Africa
	    and the fact that the highest number of fellowship
	    applications came from the country.</p>
	  <p>Applications for the 1 March 2012 fellowship intake
	    closed on 1 November 2011 and applications for the 1
	    September 2012 fellowship intake closed on 1 May
	    2012. Applications were accepted throughout the year.</p>

	<p>80% of this year&apos;s spend at the Foundation was on
	  fellow grants and projects. The start date of the Fellowship
	  impacts the spending pattern on project funds, therefore the
	  average spend per fellow is below the available project
	  budget of $228k. That is, a fellow that started on 1
	  September would have a spent less than a fellow who started
	  on 1 March.</p>
	<p>During this financial year, we had 10 fellows onboard.</p>
