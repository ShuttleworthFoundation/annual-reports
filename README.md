Annual Reports
==============

The Shuttleworth Foundation is striving to create an open knowledge society, both in South Africa and around the world. It is a vision that will only be truly realised when all people are free to learn, invent, innovate and, ultimately, create their own opportunities.

The Annual Reports offer a glimpse into the ways in which the Foundation has been working to achieve this vision. This is the code repository for the 2012 and later reports.
